class RadialPooling(nn.Module):

    Predicting Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity <https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10603>`__.

    We denote the distance between atom :math:`i` and :math:`j` by :math:`r_{ij}`.

    A radial pooling layer transforms distances with radial filters. For radial filter
    indexed by :math:`k`, it projects edge distances with

    .. math::
        h_{ij}^{k} = \exp(-\gamma_{k}|r_{ij}-r_{k}|^2)

    If :math:`r_{ij} < c_k`,

    .. math::
        f_{ij}^{k} = 0.5 * \cos(\frac{\pi r_{ij}}{c_k} + 1),

    else,

    .. math::
        f_{ij}^{k} = 0.

    Finally,

        e_{ij}^{k} = h_{ij}^{k} * f_{ij}^{k}

        and two atoms are considered as connected if the distance between them is smaller than
        the cutoffs. K for the number of radial filters.

class AtomicConv(nn.Module):
    r"""Atomic Convolution Layer from paper `Atomic Convolutional Networks for

    We denote the type of atom :math:`i` by :math:`z_i` and the distance between atom
    :math:`i` and :math:`j` by :math:`r_{ij}`.

    **Distance Transformation**

    An atomic convolution layer first transforms distances with radial filters and
    then perform a pooling operation.

    For radial filter indexed by :math:`k`, it projects edge distances with

    .. math::
        h_{ij}^{k} = \exp(-\gamma_{k}|r_{ij}-r_{k}|^2)

    If :math:`r_{ij} < c_k`,

    .. math::
        f_{ij}^{k} = 0.5 * \cos(\frac{\pi r_{ij}}{c_k} + 1),

    else,

    .. math::
        f_{ij}^{k} = 0.

    Finally,

    .. math::
        e_{ij}^{k} = h_{ij}^{k} * f_{ij}^{k}

    **Aggregation**

    For each type :math:`t`, each atom collects distance information from all neighbor atoms
    of type :math:`t`:

    .. math::
        p_{i, t}^{k} = \sum_{j\in N(i)} e_{ij}^{k} * 1(z_j == t)

    We concatenate the results for all RBF kernels and atom types.

    Notes
    -----

    * This convolution operation is designed for molecular graphs in Chemistry, but it might
      be possible to extend it to more general graphs.

    * There seems to be an inconsistency about the definition of :math:`e_{ij}^{k}` in the
      paper and the author's implementation. We follow the author's implementation. In the
      paper, :math:`e_{ij}^{k}` was defined as
      :math:`\exp(-\gamma_{k}|r_{ij}-r_{k}|^2 * f_{ij}^{k})`.

    * :math:`\gamma_{k}`, :math:`r_k` and :math:`c_k` are all learnable.
