    Introduced in "`Dynamic Graph CNN for Learning on Point Clouds
    <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07829>`__".  Can be described as follows:

    .. math::

    where :math:`\mathcal{N}(i)` is the neighbor of :math:`i`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_feat : int
        Input feature size.
    out_feat : int
        Output feature size.
    batch_norm : bool
        Whether to include batch normalization on messages.

                #
                # (1) When the point clouds within each batch do not have the
                #     same number of points, batch norm would not work.
                #
                # (2) Even if the point clouds always have the same number of
                #     points, the points may as well be shuffled even with the
                #     same (type of) object (and the official implementation
                #     *does* shuffle the points of the same example for each
                #     epoch).
                #
                #     For example, the first point of a point cloud of an
                #     airplane does not always necessarily reside at its nose.
                #
                #     In this case, the learned statistics of each position
                #     by batch norm is not as meaningful as those learned from
                #     images.
