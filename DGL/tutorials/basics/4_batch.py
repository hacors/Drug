In this tutorial, you learn how to use DGL to batch multiple graphs of variable size and shape. The 
tutorial also demonstrates training a graph neural network for a simple graph classification task.

Graph classification is an important problem
with applications across many fields, such as bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, social
network analysis, urban computing, and cybersecurity. Applying graph neural
networks to this problem has been a popular approach recently. This can be seen in the following reserach references:

# Simple graph classification task
# --------------------------------
# In this tutorial, you learn how to perform batched graph classification
# with DGL. The example task objective is to classify eight types of topologies shown here.

# Implement a synthetic dataset :class:`data.MiniGCDataset` in DGL. The dataset has eight 
# different types of graphs and each class has the same number of graph samples.

from dgl.data import MiniGCDataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx
# A dataset with 80 samples, each graph is
# of size [10, 20]
dataset = MiniGCDataset(80, 10, 20)
graph, label = dataset[0]
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
nx.draw(graph.to_networkx(), ax=ax)
ax.set_title('Class: {:d}'.format(label))

# Form a graph mini-batch
# -----------------------
# To train neural networks efficiently, a common practice is to batch
# multiple samples together to form a mini-batch. Batching fixed-shaped tensor
# inputs is common. For example, batching two images of size 28 x 28
# gives a tensor of shape 2 x 28 x 28. By contrast, batching graph inputs
# has two challenges:
#
# * Graphs are sparse.
# * Graphs can have various length. For example, number of nodes and edges.
#
# To address this, DGL provides a :func:`dgl.batch` API. It leverages the idea that
# a batch of graphs can be viewed as a large graph that has many disjointed 
# connected components. Below is a visualization that gives the general idea.
#
# .. image:: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dgl.ai/tutorial/batch/batch.png
#     :width: 400pt
#     :align: center
#
# Define the following ``collate`` function to form a mini-batch from a given
# list of graph and label pairs.

import dgl

def collate(samples):
    # The input `samples` is a list of pairs
    #  (graph, label).
    graphs, labels = map(list, zip(*samples))
    batched_graph = dgl.batch(graphs)
    return batched_graph, torch.tensor(labels)

###############################################################################
# The return type of :func:`dgl.batch` is still a graph. In the same way, 
# a batch of tensors is still a tensor. This means that any code that works
# for one graph immediately works for a batch of graphs. More importantly,
# because DGL processes messages on all nodes and edges in parallel, this greatly
# improves efficiency.
#
# Graph classifier
# ----------------
# Graph classification proceeds as follows.
#
# .. image:: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dgl.ai/tutorial/batch/graph_classifier.png
#
# From a batch of graphs, perform message passing and graph convolution
# for nodes to communicate with others. After message passing, compute a
# tensor for graph representation from node (and edge) attributes. This step might 
# be called readout or aggregation. Finally, the graph 
# representations are fed into a classifier :math:`g` to predict the graph labels.
#
# Graph convolution
# -----------------
# The graph convolution operation is basically the same as that for graph convolutional network (GCN). To learn more, 
# see the GCN `tutorial <https://docs.dgl.ai/tutorials/models/1_gnn/1_gcn.html>`_). The only difference is
# that we replace :math:`h_{v}^{(l+1)} = \text{ReLU}\left(b^{(l)}+\sum_{u\in\mathcal{N}(v)}h_{u}^{(l)}W^{(l)}\right)` 
# by
# :math:`h_{v}^{(l+1)} = \text{ReLU}\left(b^{(l)}+\frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}(v)|}\sum_{u\in\mathcal{N}(v)}h_{u}^{(l)}W^{(l)}\right)`
# 
# The replacement of summation by average is to balance nodes with different
# degrees. This gives a better performance for this experiment.
#
# The self edges added in the dataset initialization allows you to
# include the original node feature :math:`h_{v}^{(l)}` when taking the average.

import dgl.function as fn
import torch
import torch.nn as nn


# Sends a message of node feature h.
msg = fn.copy_src(src='h', out='m')

def reduce(nodes):
    """Take an average over all neighbor node features hu and use it to
    overwrite the original node feature."""
    accum = torch.mean(nodes.mailbox['m'], 1)
    return {'h': accum}

# What's next?
# ------------
# Graph classification with graph neural networks is still a new field.
# It's waiting for people to bring more exciting discoveries. The work requires 
# mapping different graphs to different embeddings, while preserving
# their structural similarity in the embedding space. To learn more about it, see 
# `How Powerful Are Graph Neural Networks? <https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826>`_ a research paper  
# published for the International Conference on Learning Representations 2019.
