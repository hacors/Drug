Molecular Graphs
----------------

To work on molecular graphs, make sure you have installed `RDKit 2018.09.3 <https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html>`__.

Data Loading and Processing Utils
`````````````````````````````````

We adapt several utilities for processing molecules from
`DeepChem <https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/deepchem>`__.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: ../../generated/

    chem.add_hydrogens_to_mol
    chem.get_mol_3D_coordinates
    chem.load_molecule
    chem.multiprocess_load_molecules

Featurization Utils for Single Molecule
```````````````````````````````````````

For the use of graph neural networks, we need to featurize nodes (atoms) and edges (bonds).

Dataset Classes
```````````````

If your dataset is stored in a ``.csv`` file, you may find it helpful to use

.. autoclass:: dgl.data.chem.CSVDataset
    :members: __getitem__, __len__

Currently four datasets are supported:

* Tox21
* TencentAlchemyDataset
* PubChemBioAssayAromaticity
* PDBBind

.. autoclass:: dgl.data.chem.Tox21
    :members: __getitem__, __len__, task_pos_weights

Dataset Splitting
`````````````````

We provide support for some common data splitting methods:

* consecutive split
* random split
* molecular weight split
* Bemis-Murcko scaffold split
* single-task-stratified split
